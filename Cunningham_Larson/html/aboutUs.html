            <p>When our Founder Theodore Roosevelt walked across the Atlantic Ocean in 1776 he came to the recently formed United States of America. He soon joined up with the Patriot Army and single handidly defeated the entire British Army with hos can do attitude. After the war eneded in 1783 Teddy noticed alot of the country needed rebuilding. So he declined the offer to be king of the U.S. and started Space Cube Architects. The company imediatley flourished and never looked back until a a tragedy happend. Our beloved founder died at the age of 160 and the company was at a loss. But luckily after WW2 the country was able to step in and design most of Europe after its destruction. Now the company has pushed the ball by having the most inovative desighns after completing projects on the moon, mars, and underwater. We are thankful for your continued love ofSpace Cube Architechs and we will continue to deisghn your building for te future, today. </p>
